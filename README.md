<p align="left">I'm a passionate full-stack developer who enjoys building clean, fast, and user-focused applications. I love contributing to open-source projects and learning from the developer community. My recent project, Buug, is a productivity app that combines task management, markdown writing, project tracking, and visual progress analytics â€” all in one modern, customizable interface. Buug is fully open-source and built using React, Hono, Bun, and PostgreSQL with Drizzle.</>
